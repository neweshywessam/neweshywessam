## About me

Hi there,

I am a researcher at Laval University, with specialization in environmental data analysis. I am passionate about solving complex data problems and creating meaningful insights from large datasets. I have a good knowledge of R, SQL and Python, and I have basic experience with Tableau. I am constantly updating my skills to stay ahead of the ever-evolving technology landscape. Currently, I am working towards obtaining a certificate in Data Science, which will further enhance my knowledge in the field.

This GitHub profile is a reflection of my work and passion for data analysis. Here, you will find a collection of my data-driven projects, including coding exercises, data visualizations, and machine learning algorithms.

I am always open to new opportunities in the field of data analysis, and I am currently seeking junior positions that allow me to expand my skillset and contribute to the team's growth.

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or opportunities.
